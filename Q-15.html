    <h1>What is the result of evaluating the expression (5 > 3 && 2 < 4)?</h1>

    <h2>The answer is true</h2>
    <h3>Explanation</h3>
    <p>The first part of the expression, 5 > 3, is true, and the second part, 2 < 4, is also true. Since both conditions are true, the combined result of true && true is true.</p>
