    <title>JavaScript Looping Constructs</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>JavaScript provides several looping mechanisms:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>for loop:</strong> Repeats a block of code a set number of times.</li>
        <li><strong>while loop:</strong> Continues to execute a block of code as long as a given condition remains true.</li>
        <li><strong>do-while loop:</strong> Functions like a while loop but guarantees at least one execution of the code block before checking the condition.</li>
        <li><strong>for...in loop:</strong> Loops through the enumerable properties of an object.</li>
        <li><strong>for...of loop:</strong> Iterates over iterable objects such as arrays and strings.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These looping constructs offer versatility in executing code repetitively based on various conditions and data structures in JavaScript.</p>
    <h2>Hereâ€™s an example of the <code>for</code> loop in action:</h2>
    <script>
        for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    </script>
