    <h1>Understanding Conditional Statements</h1>
    <p>
        Conditional statements allow you to run specific blocks of code based on whether certain conditions are met. If a given condition is true, one block of code is executed; otherwise, another block is executed based on the condition that is fulfilled.</p>

<p>There are several techniques available for handling conditional logic in JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>if statement:</strong> Runs a block of code only if a specific condition evaluates to true.</li>
    <li><strong>else statement:</strong> Runs a block of code if the preceding if condition evaluates to false.</li>
    <li><strong>else if statement:</strong> Introduces additional conditions after an if statement, testing for multiple alternatives.</li>
    <li><strong>switch statement:</strong> Evaluates an expression and executes the corresponding case that matches the value of the expression.</li>
    <li><strong>ternary operator:</strong> A shorthand way to write if-else statements in a single line.</li>
</ul>
